# Sorting Algorithms
 
• Includes five sorting algorithms (selection sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort)
 
• Manually add numbers to data set, generate a random set of numbers or load numbers from

• Load numbers from a txt file

• Displays information about the sort chosen such as the size of the data set, number of comparisons, number of swaps and the total time taken to sort the data

• Options to shuffle, clear and display the contents of the data set

I hope to create a GUI for this program in the future.
